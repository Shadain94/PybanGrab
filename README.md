# PybanGrab
a simple python banner grabber

This python banner grabber should run out the box and may require root access.
The bannergrabber does not take sys arguments and all the inputs will be done via the program to make things more simple. 

This could be picked up by a sensative intrusion detection system.

I am not going to be held accountable or responsiable for the any misuse of the program. Use this software on your own system or with a written argrement of the scope from the owner of the target.
